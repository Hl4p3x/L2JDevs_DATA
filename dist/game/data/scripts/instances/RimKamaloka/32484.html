We're trackers sent from the Ivory Tower to resist the nightmare invasion. We are waiting for a traveler like you to challenge darkness in the outskirts of Kamaloka.<br>
The surroundings of Kamaloka are the invasion of darkness through dreams. If we do not stop him, then people will die in their sleep.<br>
We have developed a countermeasure. If you are brave enough, challenge the Outskirts of Kamaloka!<br>
